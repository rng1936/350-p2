Matthew Zhou - Made sys functions and sys wrapper functions, for child first. With in the fork function based on if the if the child first variable had a 0 or 1; then fork function it will yeild or not.
Also made sys funcitons and wrapper functions for the set schded. Had a global variable for if stride sched would to be used as the scheduing process or not.

Ronald Ng - I implemented transfer_tickets() and distributeTickets(). transfer_tickets() transfers tickets from the current process to a target process. distributeTickets() distributes the number of tickets evenly to all active processes as well as whenever a process added or removed in the system. I also added the helper functions getActiveProcNum() to find the number of active processes and findProc() to find a process using the pid as the argument. 

Vincenzo Cataneo- I implemented the tickets_owned() function. The tickets_owned() function takes a given process and then will return the number of tickets said process has assigned to it. The wrapper function uses a given pid to do the previously stated functionality.
